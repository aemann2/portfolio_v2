A portfolio for my projects. This is an overhaul of a [previous portfolio](https://github.com/aemann2/portfolio). As my coding skills have improved, I wanted to optimize for performance and reorganize the structure of this project to make it easier to add new content. It also shows how far I've come since making the first portfolio! To demonstrate that I know how to code in vanilla JS, I chose not to use a framework for this portfolio.

Not every project is included here -- I've focused on the work I think is most representative of the technologies I've learned, or that demonstrates a step forward in my learning. I've tried to vary the types of projects I've included. It's a work in progress and I'll be adding to it as I apply for jobs and improve my skills.

## What I changed from the previous version
- Added a second font for stylistic contrast
- Added a "Skills" section
- Made the "About Me" section more attractive with a background SVG
- Reorganized my CSS into managable modules instead of one monster file
- Stopped using IDs for styling!
- Started using BEM
- Wrote mobile-first CSS
- Compressed images and removed gifs to improve loading time
- Used Swiper for the photo slider
- Used a better library to make autoscroll work on Safari
- Added GSAP animations

## Technology:

HTML, CSS, SASS, GSAP, Swiper, vanilla Javascript
