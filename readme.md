A portfolio for my projects. This is an overhaul of a [previous portfolio](https://github.com/aemann2/portfolio). As my coding skills have improved, I wanted to optimize for performance and reorganize the structure of this project to make it easier to add new content. It also shows how far I've come since making the first portfolio!

Not every project is included here -- I've focused on the work I think is most representative of the technologies I've learned, or that demonstrates a step forward in my learning. I've tried to vary the types of projects I've included. It's a work in progress and I'll be adding to it as I apply for jobs and improve my skills.

## Technology:

HTML, CSS, SASS, GSAP, Swiper, vanilla Javascript
